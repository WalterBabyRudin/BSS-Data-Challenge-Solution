\section{Introduction}

In the introduction, you should include an overview of the approach. Throughout the document include citations as appropriate. As an example, include citations of the form: (BSS, 2023) or BSS (2023). Included figures and tables should be labeled and captioned with a short description.



\section{Problem Setup}
Consider a retailer who sells a single product with finite amount of inventory.
Assume the amount of inventory available for sale, denoted as $y\in\mathbb{R}_+$ is known to the retailer, and he/her determines the price $p\in[p^l, p^u]$ for sale.
%an unit price $p\in[p^l, p^u]$ for each product to sale.
Besides, the retailer is provided with the competitors' selling information $z\in \mathbb{R}^{M}$ with $M\in\mathbb{N}_+$, which can be viewed as a covariate variable.
Here we assume that both the price decision $p$ and the covariate $z$ will influence the distribution of the customer demand $D$, which follows the probability distribution $f_D(p, z)$.
%demand distribution, denoted as $D\sim f_D(p, z)$.
The goal is to select the optimal price such that the expected profit $\mathbb{E}_{D\sim f_D(p,z)}[c(p,D)]$ is maximized.
In the following, we provide the detailed expression regarding the loss function $c(p,D)$.

\noindent{\bf Loss Model.}
%\paragraph{Loss Model.}
It is known that the profit depends on \emph{sales}, \emph{Cost of Goods Sold}~(COGs), \emph{eCommerce Fee}~(FBA), \emph{Referral Fee}~(REFFEE), and \emph{Ad Spend}~(ADSPEND). 
Given the price $p$, customer demand $D$, and inventory level $y$, we know $\mathrm{sales}=p(D\land y)$.
We make the following assumption regarding the other four factors:
\begin{assumption}\label{Assumption:model}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
$\mathrm{COGs} = a_1\cdot(D\land y)$.
    \item
$\mathrm{FBA} = a_2\cdot(D\land y)$.
    \item
$\mathrm{REFFEE} =15\%\cdot p(D\land y)$.
     \item
$\mathrm{ADSPEND}$ is a constant independent of any variable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{assumption}
Here we validate these assumptions using the provided SKU dataset \textsf{File Folders SKU 21} and it turns out that these models fit the data with high confidence level.
Specifically, the coefficients $a_1=4.43965609, a_2=6.60097822$.
Based on Assumption~\ref{Assumption:model}, we re-write the loss function $c(p,D)=0.85\cdot p(D\land y) - (a_1+a_2)\cdot (D\land y) - \mathrm{ADSPEND}$.
Therefore, the profit maximization problem with known demand distribution becomes
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:true:loss}
\max_{p\in[p^l, p^u]}~\mathbb{E}_{D\sim f_D(p,z)}\Big[ 
0.85\cdot p(D\land y) - (a_1+a_2)\cdot (D\land y) 
\Big] - \mathrm{ADSPEND}
\end{equation}
In practice, we assume the inventory level $y$, covariate (i.e., competitors' prices) $z$, and constant $\mathrm{ADSPEND}$ are given.
For example, with the given dataset, one can estimate $y, z, \mathrm{ADSPEND}$ based on time series prediction using historical data.
From the plot in Figure~\ref{fig:adspend}, we find the variable $\mathrm{ADSPEND}$ seems to be correlated with $\mathrm{unitsordered}$.
So we predict the future value of $\mathrm{ADSPEND}$ based on historical data of $\mathrm{ADSPEND}$ and $\mathrm{unitsordered}$ jointly.

\end{figure}
However, the demand distribution $f_D(p,z)$ is usually not available.
In the following, we provide a non-parametric and data-driven way for estimating $f_D(p,z)$ based on the collected data.

\noindent 
{\bf Demand Distribution.}
We provide a data-driven estimation of the demand distribution $f_D(p,z)$, in which only data samples $\{(p^i, z^i, D^i)\}_{i=1}^N$ are available. 
For a given price-covariate pair $(p,z)$, we approximate the true demand distribution using the weighted discrete distribution sharing the same support of the training dataset:
\[
\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_n^{(p,z)} = \sum_{i=1}^N\omega^i(p,z)\delta_{D^i},
\]
where the weight function $\{\omega^i(p,z)\}_{i=1}^N$ are obtained using the (Gaussian) kernel regression model:
\[
\omega^i(p,z)\propto \exp\left( 
\frac{-\|(p,z) - (p^i,z^i)\|_2^2}{2\sigma^2}
\right),\quad 
\sum_{i=1}^N\omega^i(p,z)=1.
\]
%$k$-nearest neighbor model.
%random forest model following techniques from the existing literature~\citep{bertsimas2020predictive}.
Previous studies have proposed several modeling for the customer demand, such as additive model~\cite{biswas2018price}, \cite{wang2015optimal}, multiplicative model~\cite{kazaz2015price}, \cite{salinger2011simple}, and linear model~\cite{bu2022context}. However, it is vague whether those models result in accurate estimation of the demand in our setting because the covariate $z$ is involved. 
Instead we use a data-driven estimator in this part, which is quite flexible as we "let the data speak for itself".


\noindent 
{\bf Distributionally Robust Formulation.}
A natural idea is to solve the sample average approximation~(SAA) counterpart of problem~\eqref{Eq:true:loss}, i.e., by replacing $f_D(p,z)$ with the estimated distribution $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_n$ and solve the approximated problem.
However, the SAA problem may not achieve satisfactory performance because the distributional estimate $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_n$ is not accurate enough.
Instead, we consider solving the distributionally robust counterpart of the SAA problem using the %KL-divergence 
$2$-Wasserstein distance
to model the ambiguity set:
\[
\max_{p\in[p^l, p^u]}~\left\{\min_{ \mathbb{P}:~\mathrm{supp}(\mathbb{P})\subseteq \mathrm{supp}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_n^{(p,z)})}~\mathbb{E}_{D\sim \mathbb{P}}[c(p,D)]:~
\mathcal{W}\left(\mathbb{P},\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_n^{(p,z)}\right)\le \epsilon
\right\}.
\]
For fixed price $p$ and covariate $z$, the inner minimization problem can be reformulated as a linear program:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}, \nu\in\mathbb{R}^N_+}&\quad 
\sum_{i=1}^N\nu_ic(p, D^i)\\
\mbox{s.t.}&\quad \sum_{i=1}^N\gamma_{i,j}=\nu_j, \sum_{j=1}^N\gamma_{i,j}=\omega^i(p,z)\\
&\quad \sum_{i,j=1}^N\gamma_{i,j}|D^i - D^j|^2\le \epsilon^2.
\end{aligned}
\]
